# Masking of the params file is typically done to allow nvkind to
# selectively exclude certain GPUs from being visible to the
# underlying GPU driver. Unfortunately, kind doesn't let you choose
# which device nodes to inject into each worker node (they all come in
# via the --priviliged flag passed to docker/podman). Because of
# this, all workers see all GPUs by default. By masking the params
# file we can prevent a container from recreating any missing GPU
# device nodes and limit its view to only those device nodes that
# nvkind decided to allow in.
